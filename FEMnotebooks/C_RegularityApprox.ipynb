    "We have [already seen](B_ProjectionBAE.ipynb) that the polynomial degree $p$ and mesh size $h$ are important factors in how best approximation errors decrease.  The regularity (or smoothness) of the approximating function also plays an important role in how well the function can approximated in a finite element space. We have seen theoretical examples of this phenomena in the lectures. The purpose of this notebook is to augment the theoretical understanding with practical manifestation of the role of regularity in rates of approximation. \n",

However, this result does not apply here since the derivative  $u'(x)$ of  $u(x) = x^{1/3}$  is not in $L^2(0, 1)$. Since $u \\in L^2$ and $u' \\not\\in L^2$,  we suspect we might only get some intermediate convergence rate between 0 and 1 for the best approximation error of this $u$. We proceed to compute this rate. First, recall the projection routine from a [previous notebook](./B_ProjectionBAE.ipynb)."
