    "An alternate approach is motivated by the following computational thinking. At the singular limit of $\\kappa=0$, the essential boundary conditions suddenly change (and so does the space in the weak form). Could we formulate a weak form where one could use the same space for $\\kappa>0$ and for $\\kappa=0$?  Also, reviewing the solutions computed for the convection-diffusion equation, it appears as if our method is overly constrained by the need to satisfy the boundary conditions strongly, or exactly. Could we relax the imposition of the boundary condition in some way?  "

We proceed to see Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods which remain stable in the convection-dominated regime as well as in the pure advection case. The DG method can be viewed as a method obtained by applying the idea of weak boundary condition imposition not just on the boundary of the domain, but to the boundary of every element in the mesh. As we shall see, they lead to practicaly useful methods with rigorously provable stability properties. "
