    "Now that we have the right hand side prepared, we can solve for $A$. Of course, we must deal with the same non-uniqueness problem we encountered in Example 1. This time we illustrate another technique to overcome the problem. Instead of orthogonalizing $A$ against gradients, we use an ngsolve facility to create an $H(\\curl)$-conforming space from which most gradient shape functions have been removed. This together with the addition of a small term that prevents the system from having a null space is a reasonable practical technique to overcome the nonuniqueness. Even if  it may not be as mathematically satisfying as the previous foolproof mixed method technique of Example 1, it does have the advantage that we can solve a much larger sized problem with a simple iterative solver, namely conjugate gradients, without huge memory demands."
